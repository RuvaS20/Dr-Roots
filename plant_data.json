        "Scientific Name": "Aloe barbadensis",
        "Common Name": "Aloe vera",
        "Shona Name": "Gavakava",
        "Physical Description": "- Succulent herb with thick leaves. Leaf edges are serrated. Inside, leaves have clear gel, surrounded by latex, and covered by a thick rind. Often used for its gel.",
        "Reported Medicinal Uses": "- Constipation\n- Gonorrhoea\n- Seborrheic dermatitis\n- Skin burns",
        "Reported Biological / Pharmacological Activities": "- Alkaloids\n- Phenolic compounds\n- Antioxidant capacity\n- Anti-inflammatory\n- Anti-microbial",
        "Preparation Methods & Parts Used": "- An extract from the leaves can be drunk as medicine or applied topically as a skin gel.",
        "Safety Precautions": "- Topical: may cause redness, burning, stinging sensation and rarely generalized dermatitis in sensitive individuals. Allergic reactions are mostly due to anthraquinones, such as aloin and barbaloin. It is best to apply it to a small area first to test for possible allergic reaction.\n- Oral: Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, red urine, hepatitis, dependency or worsening of constipation. Prolonged use has been reported to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Laxative effect may cause electrolyte imbalances (low potassium levels).\n- Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Oral aloe is not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical stimulation of uterine contractions, and in breastfeeding mothers, it may sometimes cause gastrointestinal distress in the nursing infant.\n- Interactions: Application of aloe to skin may increase the absorption of steroid creams such as hydrocortisone. It reduces the effectiveness and may increase the adverse effects of digoxin and digitoxin, due to its potassium-lowering effect. Combined use of Aloe vera and furosemide may increase the risk of potassium depletion. It decreases the blood sugar levels and thus may interact with oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin.",
