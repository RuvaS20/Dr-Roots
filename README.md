5. Lantana camara L. - Mbarambati
6. Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. - Mulemoni
7. Mangifera indica L. - Mumango

## Technology Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab (for model training)
- Twilio API (for WhatsApp integration)
- Google Cloud Platform (for deployment)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a Google Colab environment
3. Upload the dataset to Google Drive
4. Run the model training notebook
5. Deploy the model to Google Cloud Platform
